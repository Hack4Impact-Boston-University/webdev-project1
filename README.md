# Mini Project 1: Beautiful To Do List Application
First Web Development Project

### **Note:** the Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy Course is **very** detailed. 

   - Completing this project requires knowledge about HTML, CSS, Javascript, 
    and DOM Manipulation (section 15). 

   - Because of this, as you are learning, I recommend following this condensed 
    version of the course :arrow_down:

## The project will be a to build an app that allows a user to:
- create a new task and add it to the to-do list
- check off a task from the list when it is complete (delete the task)
 
 

## Key Features of the App
*Reference section 13 for a to-do list code along in the console and reference section 16 the score keeper project for logic about button events*

  ### 1. An Introduction Screen 
      
      - displays the current list (will likely be empty at first or you can add some preset tasks)
      - Buttons:
          - Button 1: "Add a task" to the list
          - Button 2: "Delete a task" from the list when it is complete
      - displays the number of completed tasks
 
  ### 2. Add a Task Feature
*Reference section 13 for a to-do list code along in the console*
      
      - on a Button 1 click, use Javascript programming logic to implement adding a task 
        (think arrays or another data structure!)
      - then, use DOM manipulation to display the new task to the screen
      
  ### 3. Delete a Task Feature

**Feel free to be creative here! 
If you can think of a different way to delete tasks, like interactive checkboxes that remove the task, that works too!** 
      
      - on a Button 2 click, use Javascript programming logic to:
            - decide which task to delete
            - implement deleting the task
            
      - then, use DOM manipulation to delete the task from the screen 

## Key Design of the App
      Make the app look inviting and fun to use!
